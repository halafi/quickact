## ‚öõÔ∏è Quickact

Production ready lightweight React starter.

If you don't like `create-react-app` after you eject.

Just shallow clone and setup as a new repo:

1. `git clone --depth=1 --branch=master git@github.com:halafi/quickact.git newProjectName`
2. `rm -rf ./newProjectName/.git`
3. Update all dependencies to latest versions if applicable with e.g. [npm-check-updates](https://github.com/tjunnone/npm-check-updates): `ncu -u`
4. `npm i`

Start developing. That's it.
