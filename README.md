# Template for your next React app

Production ready lightweight React starter.

If you plan to use React in production and don't like `create-react-app` after you eject.

Primarily aimed at **client side single page apps**.

To create a new project based on this template using <a href="https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit" target="_blank">degit</a>:

```bash
  npx degit halafi/quickact react-app
  cd react-app
```

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
  cd react-app
  yarn
```

...then start:

```bash
  yarn start
```

Navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You should see your app running.
